# 🧠 Neural Network Algorithms from Scratch

This repository is dedicated to the study and implementation of fundamental neural network algorithms and concepts using **C++**. The primary goal is educational: to understand the mathematical principles and mechanics of deep learning models without relying on high-level libraries.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is built using standard C++ features and requires a modern C++ compiler (C++11 or later) such as GCC or Clang.

### Prerequisites

* A C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
* `make` (optional, for simple compilation).

### Compilation and Execution

(Assuming your files are organized in a typical source/include structure.)

```bash
# Example compilation command for a single file (e.g., slp_main.cpp)
g++ -std=c++17 src/slp_main.cpp -o nn_study
./nn_study
